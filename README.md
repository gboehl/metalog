## Metalog Distribution

The metalog distributions constitute a new system of continuous univariate probability distributions designed for flexibility, simplicity, and ease/speed of use in practice. The system is comprised of unbounded, semi-bounded, and bounded distributions, each of which offers nearly unlimited shape flexibility compared to Pearson, Johnson, and other traditional systems of distributions.
